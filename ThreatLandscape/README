# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
## Text Clustering:
The file text_to_cluster.txt contains around 650 lines. You need to cluster the lines/sentences into distinct groups using any clustering algorithm of your choice. You need to design and code your module in a way such that the user can give as input a path to a text file, which will contain sentences as given in the 
"text_to_cluster.txt" file. Your code should algorithimically decide the optimum 
number of clusters if the clustering algorithm you decide to use requires the 
number of clusters as input, for example kmeans requires k as input. So, for 
example, if you decide to choose kmeans, then your code should decide the optimum 
k and not take k as input from the end user.
