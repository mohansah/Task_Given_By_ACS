# Task given by Aganitha Cognitive Solutions

## Part 1
Create a reusable library that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english. For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.

## Part 2
Design a spoken english to written english conversion system that can be continuously matured as you discover more and more conversion rules. For example, you may not have taken care of punctuation rules in the previous part of the exercise. Can you design in a way that such rules can be easily added without having to re-test all the previous rule implementations?
