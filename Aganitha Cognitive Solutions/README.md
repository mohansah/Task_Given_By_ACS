# Problem
Create a reusable library that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english. For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.
# Solution
To create a package in Python, we need to follow these three simple steps:
1. First, we create a directory and give it a package name, preferably related to its operation.
2. Then we put the classes and the required functions in it.
3. Finally we create an __init__.py file inside the directory, to let Python know that the directory is a package.

In the given task
1. First I created a directory and named it convert.
2. Then I need to create modules. To do this I created a file with the name converter.py and wrote required code into it.
3. Finally I created the __init__.py file. This file will be placed inside convert directory and can be left blank or we can put this initialisation code into it. I left it blank.

Now, by doing all these steps my package is sucessfully created and ready to use. To do this I created a Task.ipynb file in the same directory where convert package is located and wrote the requied code.
