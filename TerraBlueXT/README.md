# Problem Statement
Time Series forecasting techniques are very important for a data scientist to master as time series data occur in every domain from medical, stock market, climate change prediction, and so on. In that note, here we have presented in front of you an opportunity to master time series forecasting techniques and along with that stand an opportunity to get an internship with TerraBlue XT.

Data consist of two files:
train_csv.csv: The training dataset consists of 80 observations with observation id, timestamp and feature value.

test_csv.csv: The next 40 observation along with observation id and timestamp are present here. You'll have to predict the value of feature at these timestamps, along with the RMSE score.

Value to predict: The value of feature attribute has to be predicted.
